<div class="entry-content"><p>Most of the time unit testing and integral test just aren&#8217;t enough, specially
when you&#8217;re working on exposed applications where you have no exact idea how
much they&#8217;re gonna be used or if they have to do long and heavy processing
concurrently.
I learned that the hard way, and I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;m not the only one who
went through a similar ordeal.</p>

<p>Enter the <strong>Stress Test</strong>.</p>

<p>Stress testing, as the name implies, consists in thoughtfully and deliberately
testing the stability of a system often to the breaking point of it.
This task may seam like a drag to most programmers, specially if they&#8217;re working
with a QA team.
Theres no shortage of articles and opinions saying how testing is the
responsibility of the developers too, and I want to prove that this kind of
tests are not necessarily a hindrance or a waste of time, they can be pretty fun!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve used two really handy tools for my stress tests on HTTP servers (REST
services more specifically).</p>

<h3>Siege</h3>

<p>The first one is <a href="http://www.joedog.org/siege-home/"><strong>Siege</strong></a>, its a fantastic open source benchmarking and
load-testing tool for any of the *Nix flavors.
Siege is packaged in Debian based distributions so you can just installed
directly from the repositories, if not you can always get the latest version
from the official <a href="http://www.joedog.org/pub/siege/">Siege repository</a>.</p>

<p>Once installed, Siege is incredibly easy to use. If you&#8217;re familiar with
&#8220;Unixy&#8221; applications you&#8217;re gonna love Siege.</p>

<p>If you want to simulate 30 simultaneous users hitting a single service/page
with a delay of 5 seconds between each hit for 2 minutes this should do the trick:</p>

<p><code>
siege -d5 -c30 -t120S http://website.com/hello.php
</code></p>

<p>The <strong>-c</strong> flag tells Siege how many simulated users will be executing the
service concurrently. <strong>-d</strong> indicates the delay in seconds between each
&#8220;user&#8221; hitting the service. <strong>-t</strong> tells Siege for how much time will the test
run until it stops (if this flag is not provided Siege will continue to run
until its interrupted manual, Ctrl-C most of the time). And finally the URL of
the service/website.</p>

<p>Its also possible to run a suite of different services in a single test
instead of running them individually.
You can specify a list of URL&#8217;s in a text file and use it for your tests, Siege
will execute each service one by one or at random.</p>

<p><code>
siege -d5 -c30 -t120S -i -f sitetest.txt
</code></p>

<p>Most of these commands should be familiar except the last 2, <strong>-i</strong> generates
user simulation by randomly hitting the URL&#8217;s in the text file which is specified
using the <strong>-f</strong> flag.</p>

<p>While siege is running, each hit prints simple yet detailed information about
the request sent/received. Protocol used, response, delay of response,
response size and finally the service that its consuming.
When the Siege test its over, a small recap is displayed of the test results,
for me this is one of the best things about Siege, it gives you straight data
which is easy to understand.</p>

<h3>ab - Apache Bench</h3>

<p><a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/programs/ab.html">ab</a> is another fantastic benchmarking tool made by the good folks at Apache.
As Siege, this tool also comes packaged in most Debian based distos and it&#8217;s a
requirement for most of Apache&#8217;s server tools.</p>

<p>ab is also easy to jump on but it has a lot more depth than Siege on the
things yo can do with it. Here&#8217;s the previous test we ran on Siege but now
using ab with some slight differences:</p>

<p><code>
ab -n200 -c 30 http://website.com/hello.php
</code></p>

<p>For consistency&#8217;s sake, the <strong>-c</strong> flag indicates the number on concurrent
&#8220;users&#8221; hitting your service. <strong>-n</strong> sets up the number of requests the test must
complete before finishing the test.
You can also use a time limit instead of request limit using the <strong>-t</strong> flag,
it works just like the -t flag in Siege except ab takes time in milliseconds.</p>

<p>One thing I was able to do in ab that I couldn&#8217;t in Siege was testing POST
services which required a JSON file in its request.</p>

<p><code>
ab -n200 -c 30 -p {"jsonfile":{"value":"the-value"}} -T "application/json; charset=utf-8" http://website.com/hello.php &gt; testresults.log &amp;
</code></p>

<p>There&#8217;s a little more wizardry going on in this one. <strong>-p</strong> indicates a
file(JSON file in this case or a regular file when the path is present)
containing data to POST. <strong>-T</strong> sets the Content-Type header for POST/PUT data,
if you&#8217;re using the -p flag for posting it&#8217;s necessary to setup the Content-Type header.</p>

<p>Unlike Siege, ab prints the test results only when everything has finished,
thats why we are using a &#8220;>&#8221; option to print all out results to an external file.
And finally the &#8220;&amp;&#8221; character it&#8217;s a pretty standard option in Unix environments,
this indicated that this task should run in the background and once run
it immediately gives back command of the prompt to the user.</p>

<p>ab&#8217;s results are much more detailed than Siege&#8217;s results, personally I find some
of ab&#8217;s results not that necessary, but it&#8217;s always good to have the flexibility
to have all this data on hand.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/frncscgmz-blog/stresspic3.jpg" title="Finished Apache Bench test" ></p>

<p>Both ab and Siege are really handy tools with tons of functionality and a lot
of neat little things that are beyond the scope of this lowly blog post(I don&#8217;t
want to be that guy but seriously read the manuals, everything you might need
its there).
I really can&#8217;t decide to preach for just one tool, where one falls short the other
one can excel, they complement each other well and should be enjoyed equally.</p>

<p><strong>One word of warning:</strong> <em>If you&#8217;re like me, once I got to know these tools, I started
to get naughty ideas about its uses. Please refrain from using them against
servers you&#8217;re not responsible, it&#8217;s considered impolite if not straight up illegal.</em></p>
