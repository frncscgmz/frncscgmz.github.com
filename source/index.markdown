Hi, I'm **Francisco Gomez**, programmer/engineer, and this is my personal page.

I'm a passionate developer hailing from the shady lands of Tijuana, Mexico.  
I love learning new things about programing, engineering and design.  
I support Open Source and I'm a Perl-Python-Java enthusiast.  

I'm currently employed but actively searching for new and exciting projects.

You can find my ramblings in [my blog](/blog).
