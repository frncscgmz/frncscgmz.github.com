{% blockquote Douglas Hofstadter, GÃ¶del Escher Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid   %}
It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.
{% endblockquote %}

This quote will ring true to any programer who as dealt with a manager with their favorite
project managment tool open and the empty "Due date" field.

Even with my limited experience in the field, I've come to dread project estimation. 

There's never an easy answer to it, theres tons of diferent techniques on the internet 
on how deal with it put in the end theres no silver bullet.
