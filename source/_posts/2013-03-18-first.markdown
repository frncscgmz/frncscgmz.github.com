After days of inner debating I've decided to finally start writing again.
This is like the 3rd blog I've ever started and hopefully I'll keep it around for a little longer.

This blog will be dedicated to my ramblings about coding and everything in between(languagues, frameworks,
technologies, etc.).

I'm no expert on the subject, but I really like learning new things and I would love to share all the little
things I learn everyday, so If you see something wrong in this blog (besides my shaky english) you're free to point it
out on the comments section.

Thank you :-)
